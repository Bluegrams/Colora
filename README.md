> Color converter, screen color picker and color palettes for Windows

[![](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/colora/files/)

Colora is a useful small color converter and screen color picker tool for Windows. Colora makes it easy to pick colors from screen and save them.
The color picker is tested to work with Windows 10 and DPI scaling. Picked colors can be configured and converted between various formats such as
RGB, Hex, HSB and HSL. The integrated palette tool then allows you to create color palettes from selected colors or the history of picked colors.
